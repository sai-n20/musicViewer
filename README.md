This Android application demonstrates creation of a RecyclerView which can hold a variable list of items and provides scrolling functionality. The list items are curated songs which are displayed alongwith their artist and song/album image. Selecting a list item allows the user to open the respective song's YouTube page. A context menu is implemented on long-press which gives the user 3 choices,
1. Open YouTube page.
2. Open artist WikiPedia page.
3. Open song WikiPedia page.

The application allows the list to be reconfigured into a grid view, which stacks elements side by side for a more compact fit.
